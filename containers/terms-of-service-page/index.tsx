                user is directed to a Payment Gateway, Terragi Tech Solutions
                Pvt Ltd does not store or keep credit card data. Since the
                transaction happens on a third-party network not controlled by
                Terragi Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd, once a credit card transaction
                has been completed, the payment information is not accessible to
                anyone at Terragi Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd after completion of the
                on-line transaction at the Payment Gateway, this ensures the
                maximum security.
